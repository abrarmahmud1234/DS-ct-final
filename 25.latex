Plants are recognized as essential as they are the primary source of
humanity's energy production since they are having nutritious,
medicinal, etc. values. At any time between crop farming, plant diseases
can affect the leaf, resulting in enormous crop production damages and
economic market value. Therefore, in the farming industry,
identification of leaf disease plays a crucial role. It needs, however,
enormous labor, greater preparation time, and comprehensive plant
pathogen knowledge. For the identification of plant disease detection
various machine learning (ML) as well as deep learning (DL) methods are
developed \& examined by various researchers, and many of the times they
also got significant results in both cases. Motivated by those existing
works, here in this article we are comparing the performance of ML
(Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Sto-chastic Gradient
Descent (SGD)) \& DL (Inception-v3, VGG-16, VGG-19) in terms of citrus
plant disease detection. The disease classification accuracy (CA) we
received by experimentation is quite impressive as DL methods perform
better than that of ML methods in case of disease detection as follows:
RF-76.8\% \emph{\textgreater{}} SGD-86.5\% \emph{\textgreater{}} SVM-
87\% \emph{\textgreater{}} VGG-19--87.4\% \emph{\textgreater{}}
Inception-v3--89\% \emph{\textgreater{}} VGG-16--89.5\%. From the
result, we can tell that RF is giving the least CA whereas VGG-16 is
giving the best in terms of CA.

\textbf{1. Introduction}

Agriculture has been a major source of economic growth in India. The
farmer selects the required crop based on the soil type, the location's
weather condition, and economic value. As a result of rising
populations, weather changes, and political uncertainty, the
agricultural industries began to look for new methods to increase food
production. This allows researchers to look for new high productivity
innovations that are effective and accurate. Through the use of precise
agriculture in infor-mation technology, farmers may collect information
and data to make the right decision on high farm production. Precision
agriculture (PA) is a modern technology that offers sophisticated
techniques for optimizing farm production. Through making use of these
sophisticated technolo-gies, Economic development in agriculture can be
achieved. PA can be used for many applications, such as plant pest
identification, weed identification, crop yield production and detection
of plant diseases, etc. To control pests, avoid diseases, and increase
crop yield, a farmer uses pesticides. Crop diseases are causing problems
for farmers due to low

Agriculture assumes a significant part for individuals in India and the
economy of the nation.

Regular manifestations include anomalous leaf development, color
distortion, hindered development, withered, and harmed units. Even
though infections and bug vermin can cause significant yield

influ-ential to human wellbeing. These require cautious analysis and
ideal taking care of to shield the yields from weighty losses {[}2{]}.
In plants, infections can be found in different parts, for example,
natural products, stem, and leaves. Leaf presents a few points of
interest over blossoms and natural products at all seasons around the
world {[}3--5{]}.

approach being sporadic forest, SVM, fuzzy logic, K-means system,
Convolutional neural networks (CNN), etc. In agribusiness research, ML
procedures are on a very basic level used to recognize, perceive, and
anticipate crop diseases and plant pressure phenotyping. Unlike
un-mistakable confirmation of iotas subject to genomics data, ML
proced-ures in plant disease research are significantly dependent on
motorized stages, for instance, raised vehicles and ground robots with
sensors to assemble steady data from fields {[}6, 7{]}. Ordinarily, data
was removed from significant standard pictures or sensor data and a
short time later pre-taken to dispose of immaterial noteworthy
information. Space data in plant disease (PD) was fundamental for
pre-dealing with and picking an authentic strategy, which could improve
the presentation of ML conjecture {[}8{]}. ML methods were used
regularly as gadgets to perceive plant diseases. The purpose behind such
examinations is to perceive whether a sickness is accessible on plants.
A couple of assessments have utilized ML to distinguish Huanglongbing
(HLB) for citrus trees. Another critical utilization of ML is structure,
which organizes PD into different stages or different sorts. The ML
counts were genuinely applied to the gathering of fine development, an
infectious organism that causes yield mishap in varieties of harvests
{[}9,10{]}.

Our main contribution in this work is as follows:

â¢ We aimed to classify citrus leaf disease using both methods ML (SGD,
RF, SVM) \& DL (Inception-v3, VGG-16, VGG-19) to find out which one of
these is performing better in disease detection.

â¢ For classification problems stratified 10-fold cross-validation is
applied, in which the folds are chosen such that each fold contains
approximately the same ratios of the target class.

â¢ When new images are given as the input for the system, it predicts the
type of disease and helps to take contour action before the plants get
affected more.

â¢ The agriculture sector is the backbone of the nation and our work will
support to optimize the yield from the field by detecting diseased
plants earlier.

assortment of yields of being developed across India. Farmers have been
following conventional ways to deal with develop harvests and more often
than not, the yields are influenced by maladies which prompt a decrease
in farming creation. The significant theory is "inordinate uti-lization
of pesticides for plant malady treatment expands expenses and raises the
risk of poisonous build-up levels on rural items". Significantly, it
prompts misfortunes to farmers that influences their prosperity. More
often than not, a decrease in crop causes worries in farmer families

\emph{3.1. Citrus leaf disease dataset}

Citrus fruit is grown across the world and its best immune system
support for the human. Pakistan is placed in the 12th position in the
cultivation of citrus fruit across the world. It produces 2.36 million
tonnes from the 199,000 acres of the lands. Various types are pummelo,
sweet oranges, grapefruits, mandarins, and lemons. The entire plant is
holding the health benefit components. It acts as a great source of
fla-vonoids, antioxidants, and polyphenols that help in treating various
diseases like Alzheimer's, Cardiovascular, Leukaemia, Parkinson's, and
so on. The dataset used in this work was gathered manually with the
guidance of experts and citrus research center, Government of Punjab,
Pakistan located in Sargodha city. Captured the images with DSLR with
the resolution of 72 dpi and size is 256 Ã 256 pixels respectively. The
dataset is a collection of infected and healthy citrus leaves and
fruits. In our work, we utilized the leaves dataset and it's further
classified based on the most prevalent leaf diseases {[}46, 47{]}.
Dataset description of citrus leaves considered for the work is
mentioned in Table 1.

\emph{3.2. Multi-Class classification}

Each sample in the dataset will be mapped to one class label. Based on
the values of features, the classification process classifies the record
into a particular target. Number of algorithms both in ML and DL
perspective developed to work on the training dataset to generate a
model and in turn predict the class for the testing dataset. Repeated
training of the model with varied combinations is the success factor in
the data mining arena. In DL, CNN is having a great impact on the
classification of image and text datasets {[}48,49{]}. In the case of
our work, 5 class labels based on the features of the images get
classified. The various concepts behind determining the training and
testing data are k-fold cross-validation and random sampling methods. In
the former method, the original sample is randomly partitioned into
subsamples of k equal size. A single subsample is maintained from the k
subsamples as the validation data for model testing, and the remaining
k-1 subsets are used as training samples. In the later random method,
based on ration the training and testing are separated {[}50,51{]}.

\emph{3.2.1. Squeezenet (SN)}\\
Image embedding is used to provide the format that can be handled by ML
and in our work, SN is utilized. Images are given as input and produce
the vector of numbers that could be used for further processing using ML
algorithms. This embedder works faster and an internet connection is not
mandated {[}52{]}.

\emph{3.2.2. Linear-support vector machine (L-SVM)}\\
SVM is the trending classification algorithm used frequently in ML. The
initial stages were applied only in the binary classification and later
optimized the hyperplane-based algorithm to work with a multiclass
environment. SVM and variant -- SVM are the types and based on the
kernel type, various functions used in SVM are linear, polynomial,
radial basis function, and sigmoid. Optimization parameters are
numerical tolerance and iteration limit {[}53,54{]}. The linear kernel
is mentioned as given in equation 1.

\emph{k}(\emph{y, yi}) = \emph{sum}(\emph{y} â \emph{yi}) (1)

Where the product of 2 vectors y and yi is the sum of the product of
each set of input values.

In our work, SVM with cost 1.00 and regression loss epsilon of 0.10 in
the linear kernel environment with numerical tolerance of 0.0010 and
iteration limit of 100 is used as the optimization parameter. The
function of the kernel is transforming the input space that is low
dimensional into a higher dimensional space.

\textbf{4. Experimental results and discussions}

The presented work is carried out utilizing the Orange Data Mining
3.26.0 tool with 8 GB RAM \& 1 TB memory-based personal computer.

\emph{4.1. Machine learning vs deep learning classifiers}

In our study, the 10-fold cross-validation stratified classification
problem is applied, in which the folds are selected such that each fold
comprises roughly the same proportions of the target class. A sampling
of data for training and testing is a phase that helps and ensures the
complete data is utilized most fully. The accuracy of the model
primarily depends on the sampling technique involved in the model.

Based on the analysis certain pros and cons made us decide on the
following learning methods. SVM works good in all sorts of data and
issue with overfitting is less. Execution time is comparatively less.
Cheaper computation and handle the data in a normalized manner. The way
stochastic gradient descent works makes the computation faster and
converges results at the earliest. Similarly, random forest works well
in a non-linear structure, manages outliers, and overfitting with better
ac-curacy. As a part of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition
Challenge (ILVSR), several deep learning algorithms evolved to classify
the large images to the right label. In the initial stages, VGG was
developed and later based on that learning inception evolved. They are
so powerful and popular deep learning algorithms that work with image
datasets.

\emph{4.2. Confusion matrix}

A matrix that shows the class of each instance based on classifier
algorithms utilized and paved the way to various performance measures
that determine the system tendency. The number of classes determines

\begin{quote}
the dimension of the confusion matrix. The 5-class model creates a 5 Ã
5- dimension confusion matrix. It will provide clear information about
the mapping of the right and wrong class. Predicted class labels are
indi-cated in rows and actual class labels mentioned in the columns.
Based on this mapping, each cell is considered as either True Positive
(TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP) \& False Negative (FN).
Based on the prediction it is named. When predicted matches with actual
class and both are positive then it is called TP. When predicted matches
with the actual class and both are negative then is said as TN. The
prediction is not the correct and actual value is negative but positive
prediction then it falls under FP. The false prediction and actual value
are positive but negative predictions then it is FN {[}64{]}. Various
performance measures are arrived at with the help of the mentioned
prediction parameters.

\emph{4.3. Confusion matrix for ml}

Fig. 2-4 shows the confusion matrix of the ML algorithm namely RF, SGD,
and SVM. Diagonals hold the data about correctly classified in-stances
and values above and below the diagonals are misclassified in-stances.
In-case of RF, SGD, SVM correctly classified images to their target
labels are 468, 527, 530 respectively.

\emph{4.4. Confusion matrix for dl}

DL is the optimized way of building the model to have better
clas-sification by neural network structure. Fig. 5-7 illustrates the
confusion matrix of the DL algorithm namely VGG-19, Inception- V3, and
VGG-16. Diagonals hold the data about correctly classified instances and
values above and below the diagonals are misclassified instances.
In-case of VGG-19, Inception -- V3, VGG -- 16 correctly classified
images to their target labels are 532, 542, 545 respectively.

\emph{4.5. Evaluation results}

Fig. 8 depicts that in the case of the actual Black spot class the
pre-dicted values of Melanose class are not present and the Healthy \&
Canker class is having very little impact. In the actual Melanose class,
all the other classes have very little significance. In terms of the

performance in comparison. RF gives the lowest accuracy of 76.8\%
whereas VGG-16 gives higher accuracy of 89.5\%.

\textbf{5. Conclusion}

AI is the area that makes the meet in the middle between information
communication technology (ICT) with various application sectors.
De-cision making is provided by the algorithms prevailing in AI. ML and
DL are the major performers in the domain. DL works similarly to the
neural structure of the human brain with the layers and optimizers that
helps to build a reliable model proving higher accuracy. In our work
both learning, approaches are considered and DL results are appreciable
in comparison with ML. Various measures like precision, F1 score,
accu-racy, and area under the curve are considered. On comparison, we
achieved CA of RF as 76.8\% \emph{\textgreater{}} SGD as 86.5\%
\emph{\textgreater{}} SVM as 87\% \emph{\textgreater{}} VGG-19 as 87.4\%
\emph{\textgreater{}} Inception-v3 as 89\% \emph{\textgreater{}} VGG-16
as 89.5\%. Images are captured and sent to the system on the regular
basis by the stakeholders so farmers will help to decide the pesticide
to be used to prevent dam-ages. Incorporating the concept of IoT, cloud
computing, big data to gather the images, storing, transferring and
processing of the same in GPU environments will be a great support. As a
possible future work, we plan to utilize fuzzy logic \& bio-inspired
methods which may have a significant impact in case of better CA of the
system even after using a small-sized dataset.
